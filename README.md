# Practicing Data Structure

This repository contains implementations and examples of different data structures and algorithms.

## Implemented Data Structures and Algorithms

### 📌 Arrays
- 🔍 **Binary Search** - Implementation of the binary search algorithm for efficiently finding elements in a sorted array.
- 🚀 **Exponential Search** - Exponential search algorithm that improves search time for large arrays.
- 🔄 **Sliding Window** - Optimized algorithm for solving problems involving substrings and continuous subsequences of an array.

## How to Run
To run any of the algorithms, use Python 3:

```bash
python3 filename.py
```

For example, to run binary search:
```bash
python3 binary_search.py
```
